# Hello there! 🙋🏽‍♀️

#### My name is Yasmin and I'm a Senior Biomedical Engineering student at University of Houston. I have an interest in Data Science, particularly using data to solve challenges in healthcare, social determinants of health (SdoH), and technology. I have experience working as a Data Scientist at National Oilwell Varco and I have research experience at University of Maryland Baltimore County. I am currently a 2024 Pharis Fellow, where I am conducting data science research for refugees education: I am particularly investigating factors that impact language acquisition and educational attainment in refugee/asylee students attending Texas public schools.
